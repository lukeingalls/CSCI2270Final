# CSCI2270Final
This branch contains the final iteration of our project

For the c++ files this is the simple sorting of our data. Users can sort based upon 9 stats and see however many players they want from this sort. The files in this branch will be called upon the start of the program in order to load data. This process is not dependent on user input.

The Machine learning is trained with the train file and tested with the test file. Predictions can be made about the prediction file. (Train file contains player stats 2007-2017, Test has players for 2018, Prediction has 2019 all dates reflect last year which stats where availible). Uses Naive Bayes Classification.

Scrapers run and work. Raw output is pretty rough for the main scraper so the cleaner function is used to make things easier to input to c files and also divide up the data. The top two rows of these outputs have been manually deleted before use in other programs. The draft data while pull draft # and name. The column with draft numbers was manually deleted before use in ML.
